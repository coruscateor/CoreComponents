I created this library to have a single place where I could put a few different ideas.

Concepts addressed:
- Threading
- Data access
- Collections
- File system modelling

Among other things...

Compatibility:
- This library should only use BCL components that are available in both the latest versions of the .NET and Mono platforms.

TODO:
- Document the classes in the library etc...	
- Expand this README document to include discussions of the concepts represented in the project and/or start a wiki.
- Clean up the codebase
